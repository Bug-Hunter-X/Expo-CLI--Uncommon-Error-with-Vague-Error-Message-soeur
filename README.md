# Expo CLI: Uncommon Error with Vague Error Message

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Expo CLI. The error message is often vague, making debugging challenging. The issue typically stems from inconsistencies within the project's structure, dependencies, or configuration files (app.json, app.config.js). The example showcases a situation involving a mismatch between native modules and the managed workflow.

**Problem:**
The error occurs when Expo CLI fails to properly handle a complex or unusually structured project, especially when discrepancies exist between native modules and the Expo managed workflow. The error message provides limited details, hindering the debugging process.

**Solution:**
The solution involves carefully examining the project setup, including the package.json file for dependency conflicts, app.json or app.config.js for configuration errors, and ensuring compatibility between native modules and the managed Expo workflow.  Thorough cleaning and rebuilding of the project are often necessary.
