The solution involves a multi-step debugging process:

1. **Check package.json:** Look for any conflicting or missing dependencies. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
2. **Examine app.json/app.config.js:** Verify that all configurations are correct, especially those related to native modules and platform-specific settings. Ensure that any custom native modules are correctly integrated.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Use `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start` or `expo run:android` / `expo run:ios`. 
4. **Verify Native Module Compatibility:** If using native modules, ensure that their versions are compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Check the documentation for both the native module and the Expo SDK for compatibility information.
5. **Simplify the Project (Debugging Step):** If the issue persists, consider creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem.  Start by removing non-essential features from your project.
6. **Check Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you're using the latest version of the Expo CLI using `npm update -g expo-cli`.  Update to the latest stable SDK version if needed.
7. **Check the Log Files:** Examine the detailed logs from the build process.  Expo's output can sometimes contain clues about the underlying issue (even if the top level error is vague). 
8. **Expo Community Support:** If all else fails, seek assistance in the Expo community forums or GitHub issues. Provide as much detail as possible (including the exact error message, relevant portions of config files, and steps to reproduce).  A minimal reproducible example is extremely helpful.
