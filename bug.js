This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a complex or unconventional project structure.  It's often triggered by issues with package.json, dependencies, or incorrect configurations within the Expo config files (app.json or app.config.js).  The error message itself can be vague, sometimes only showing a generic error code, which makes debugging difficult. One specific example is when there's a mismatch between the project's native modules (Android/iOS) and the Expo managed workflow.
